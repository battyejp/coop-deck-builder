# Cooperative Deck Builder

A Unity-based cooperative deck-building game where players work together to overcome challenges using strategic card play and deck management.

## Project Overview

This project provides a foundational framework for creating cooperative deck-building games in Unity. Players collaborate by sharing resources, coordinating strategies, and combining their deck abilities to achieve common objectives.

### Key Features
- **Cooperative Gameplay**: Players work together towards shared goals
- **Dynamic Deck Building**: Cards can be acquired, modified, and shared between players
- **Modular Card System**: Extensible card framework supporting various card types and effects
- **Flexible Game Flow**: Adaptable turn structure supporting different cooperative mechanics

## Architecture

This project follows a modular architecture designed for extensibility:

- **Card System**: Scriptable Object-based cards with flexible effect systems
- **Deck Management**: Centralized deck operations with event-driven updates
- **Game Flow**: State machine-based game progression
- **Player Coordination**: Event-based communication between players

For detailed architectural information, see `docs/UnityProjectStructure.md`.
